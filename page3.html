<p>"Yes, I'm thinking of it," I answered; "but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow." But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try.  The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead&mdash;when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.</p>
<p>At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.</p>
<p>From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before. At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.  During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.</p>
<p>Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.</p>
<p>Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.</p>
