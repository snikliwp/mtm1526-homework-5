<p>"Eter-nity!  Eter-nity!" came echoing down the road.</p>
<p>There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their weary faces smeared with tears.  With many of these came men, sometimes helpful, sometimes lowering and savage.  Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed.  There were sturdy workmen thrusting their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen, struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a nightshirt with a coat thrown over it.</p>

The heat and dust had already been at work upon this multitude.  Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They were all thirsty, weary, and footsore.  And amid the various cries one heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices of most of them were hoarse and weak.  Through it all ran a refrain:</p>

<p>Few stopped and came aside from that flood.  The lane opened slantingly into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance of coming from the direction of London.  Yet a kind of eddy of people drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again.  A little way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have friends.</p>
