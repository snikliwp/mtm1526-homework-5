<p>At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland&mdash;no fire at all&mdash;the landlord said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind&mdash;not only meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner.</p>
<p>"My boy," said the landlord, "you'll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty."</p>

<p>"Landlord," I whispered, "that aint the harpooneer is it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, "the harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don't&mdash;he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare."</p>
<p>"The devil he does," says I. "Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?"</p>
